Long term medical condition also know as “Chronic Condition” is a human health condition or disease that is persistent or otherwise long-lasting in its effects or a disease that comes with time. (WHO)

Lack of timely interventions or delay in receiving care will typically result in worse outcomes for patients. To manage a healthy life style and reduce the possibility of severe outcomes, people with identified chronic conditions have to be active in self-care efforts.

Chiron helps people to monitor and manage their conditions better.

Typical use cases are:
1. Scheduled monitoring of health parameters
2. Scheduled medical intervention with recent records
3. Information records made available on an emergency
4. Trend information and reporting

Illnesses that disease management would concern itself with would include: deep vein thrombosis, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), kidney failure, hypertension, heart failure, obesity, diabetes mellitus, asthma, cancer,arthritis, clinical depression, sleep apnea, osteoporosis, and other common ailments.
